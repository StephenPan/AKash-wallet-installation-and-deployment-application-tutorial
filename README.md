Set up wallet
Configure wallet variables

export KEY_NAME=example
export KEYRING_BACKEND=os
Then use the command to create an account

akash \
  --keyring-backend "$KEYRING_BACKEND" \
  keys add "$KEY_NAME"
After getting the following output

➜  Downloads akash \
  --keyring-backend "$KEYRING_BACKEND" \
  keys add "$KEY_NAME"

Deploy the application
ready
Here we deploy the application to edgenettest the network on how to select a network problem can refer to network selection .

Before deployment, we need to configure our variables

export AKASH_NODE=tcp://rpc-edgenet.akashdev.net:26657
export AKASH_CHAIN_ID=akash-edgenet-1
export ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=your address
export KEY_NAME=example
export KEYRING_BACKEND=os
AKASH_NODEA node rpcaddress, from where acquired;

AKASH_CHAIN_IDIt is a node ID, you can get it from here ;

ACCOUNT_ADDRESS Is your account address;

KEY_NAME、 It KEYRING_BACKENDwas set when the wallet was configured before;

We need to have our account before deploying the application AKT. Here we apply through the faucet . After opening the website, fill in the address you generated earlier. After obtaining the amount, we can view it through the command

➜  Downloads akash query bank balances --node $AKASH_NODE $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
balances:
- amount: "100000000"
  denom: uakt
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
It should be noted about the AKT precision is 6, which is the amount we have obtained is100AKT

deploy
Create deployment configuration
We download the configuration file from deploy.yml

➜  akash vi deploy.yml

Check the status of the lease

➜  akash akash query market lease list --owner $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --node $AKASH_NODE --state active
leases:
- lease_id:
    dseq: "70506"
    gseq: 1
    oseq: 1
    owner: akash1rrw2hsj9l0zsulc6c8sgg53783mz6a7yvwy4qs
    provider: akash174hxdpuxsuys9qkauaf57ym5j8dm4secnz6jd7
  price:
    amount: "230"
    denom: uakt
  state: active
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
Here we spent 0.000230 AKTto complete this operation, let's save a few variables to help us later use

➜  akash export PROVIDER=akash1y8xhp9ekxctahvex7842h607lmwp50q0n89tw0
export DSEQ=70506
export OSEQ=1
export GSEQ=1

➜  akash echo $PROVIDER $DSEQ $OSEQ $GSEQ
akash174hxdpuxsuys9qkauaf57ym5j8dm4secnz6jd7 70506 1 1
Upload Manifest

akash provider send-manifest deploy.yml --node $AKASH_NODE --dseq $DSEQ --oseq $OSEQ --gseq $GSEQ --owner $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --provider $PROVIDER
After the upload is complete, you can view the details with the following command

akash provider lease-status --node $AKASH_NODE --dseq $DSEQ --oseq $OSEQ --gseq $GSEQ --provider $PROVIDER --owner $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
Get the following output

{
  "services": {
    "web": {
      "name": "web",
      "available": 1,
      "total": 1,
      "uris": [

      "ready-replicas": 0,

    }
  },
  "forwarded-ports": {}
}
Now you can access our deployed application through the browser cedd3wducd9typbgxbce8o.provider2.akashdev.net
